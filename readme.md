e-commerce website project

Deployment:
The site was developed using the vscode IDE and uses git for version control and pushed to GitHub.

To deploy dashboard to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, I followed these steps:

Select the repository.
Select settings from the menubar.
Scroll down to the page, on the GitHub pages click the link and select Master Branch.
The page is automatically refreshed and ready for deployment, it can take up to 5 minutes for it to be viewable.
